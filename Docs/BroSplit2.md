# Bro Split 2
 - Full Gym

This is a workout reminiscent of the traditional bro-split. It is made up of 12 weeks, with 5 workouts a week. Each workout should take around 40-50 minutes. This is a great workout to start for beginners all the way up to intermediate lifters. But likely does not have enough volume for advanced lifters.
