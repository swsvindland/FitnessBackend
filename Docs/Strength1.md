# Strength 1
 - Barbell
 - Squat Rack

This is a 3 day a week, full body program that is great for beginners. It only requires a barbell and a squat rack, and can be a great way to get introduced to resistance training. For the first few weeks of this workout, workouts could be as short as 20 minutes, but once you get to the end, could be up to about an hour. You can repeat this workout as many times as you want, so long as you are continuing to get stronger. Typically people can repeat 1-2 times before they need to switch to a different program.
